# Software Methodologies Computer Graphics Coursework

This coursework gives you an opportunity to implement a small 3D living room environment by applying your computer graphics knowledge and skills. There are different aspects for constructing a 3D environment, including object modelling, object transformation, scene graph construction, lighting, virtual camera setting, etc. Under each aspect, a variety of techniques could be used. You are expected to implement the above aspects with WebGL, demonstrating your competence in developing a computer graphics application.

## Requirements

- 3D Modelling - Create 3D models to represent a living room and at least 10 pieces of furniture inside the room
- Simple Model Animation - Apply geometric transformations to support simple animation to 30% of the furniture
- Scene Graph Construction - Implement a scene graph to support effective construction and manipulation of 3D models
- Rendering effects - Implement suitable lighting effects for the living room environment and allow the room to be rendered under adjustable virtual camera settings
- Model and Scene Appearance - Implement suitable colouring and texture mapping to support visually appealing rendering outputs
